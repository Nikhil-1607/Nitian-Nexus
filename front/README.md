# Nitian-Nexus
Our project is rooted to mitigate the paucity of shared dissemination of ideas, views and future prospects in terms of inline goals and vision. Our vision is to build a site pulling together all NIT’s under one umbrella in terms of exchange of ongoing activities, be it in the sphere of academic arena or the extravagant activities of technical and cultural clubs, the interactive notice board with possibilities of dissect will aid in adding feather to one’s vision of multiple spheres where they might be missing opportunities and will yield a better discussion forum to open channels for future goals. In our website we will be including a live chat section to share opinions with the inter and intra institution student body. There will be a notice board showcasing the present activities going in inter and intra institutions with common ground for discussion. The future prospect of this project is vivid with its accorded implementation. As it will bring forth the grounds common to all students, help in sharing future goals, get acquainted with what’s going round the place, and magnify the vision due to limited know-how.
